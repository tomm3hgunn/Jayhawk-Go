%%% Common Guidelines %%%

# Branches
- Do NOT work in the main branch
    * Any commits to main should be 100% safe. If you are working on a feature, you should be working in a separate branch.
    * Committing frequently is a good habit to get into. It allows you to revert to a previous commit if you break something, and it allows you to see what you've done in the past.
- Pull frequently to get the latest changes from teammates
- Create another branch for each feature you are working on
    * This allows you to work on multiple features at once
    * This allows you to revert to a previous commit if you break something
    * This allows you to see what you've done in the past
- Merge features that appear to be working to the dev branch
    * This allows teammates to test your code before it is merged to main.

# Issues
- Create issues for features that are being worked on or planned to be worked on
    * Assign yourself to the issue
    * Start your commit message with any of the following to link the issue # to the commit
        fix #xxx
        fixes #xxx
        fixed #xxx
        close #xxx
        closes #xxx
        closed #xxx
        resolve #xxx
        resolves #xxx
        resolved #xxx

# Commits
- Commit frequently
- Write descriptive commit messages
    * There will be a lot of commits, so it's important to be able to understand what each commit does.
    * Commit messages can be multiple lines! Just press enter for a new line.
